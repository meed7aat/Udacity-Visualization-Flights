## by (Medhat Zaki)


## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding  16,984,354 Flights. Base on the information which came from The dataset from Bureau of Transportation Statistics, it tracked the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in three years 2006,2007 and 2008. 

Dataset [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html),
with feature documentation available [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=236).



## Summary of Findings

After analyzing this data, we found that the highest cause of delays came from the carrier or weather related problems. United Air Lines Inc. (UA) , American Eagle Airlines Inc.(MQ)and American Airlines Inc.(AA)) were the worst performing carrier with highest cancellations. Atlantic Southeast airlines and Mesa airlines have highest delay from 2006 to 2008. This has been shown in the presentation with the help of graphs and charts.


## Key Insights for Presentation


For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of delay and cancellation cause and leave out most of the intermediate derivations. Since carrier performance can be gauged in terms of both these metric, they have been explored and highlighed in the presentation.
